# Simple Sabacc

The purpose of this repository is to build a simple, terminal-interactive game of Sabacc.

## What is Sabacc?

Sabacc is a card game from the popular movie franchise Star Wars™️. It is most clearly seen in the movie _Solo_.

### The Basic Deck

This game utilizes a 62 card deck instead of the more common and traditional 52 card deck. There are 3 staves (suits) that are circles (●), triangles (▲), and squares (■). Each stave has two colors that signify whether or not the card's value is negative or positive. Commonly, red signifies negative and green signifies positive. From there, each color has ten cards. That covers 60 of the 62 cards within a deck, the last two are special -- sylops. These sylops essentially have the value of zero and do not have an associated stave.
